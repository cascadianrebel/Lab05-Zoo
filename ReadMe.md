## OOP Principals
1. Inheritance
* The ability for classes to use the methods of its parent classes. 
2. Abstraction
* The ability to "template" or create models. 
3. Polymorphism
* The ability to change the class
4. Encapsulation
* The ability to limit access to code (using access modifiers like Private, Public, and Protected)

**Interfaces**
An Interface is a group of related functionalities available for a class to implement. Since C# doesn't support multiple inheritance, interfaces are used.
A class can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces are like abstract classes in that they contain no implementation of methods.
